Hello Reviewer,

Thank you for reviewing my "Little Lemon Analysis and Sales Report" project.

**Instructions to Run the Project:**

**1. Update Credentials:**
   Before running any scripts, please open both Python files (`1_setup_database.py` and `2_analysis_and_sales_report.ipynb`) and update the `dbconfig` dictionary with your OWN MySQL username and password.

   Example:
   dbconfig = {
       "user": "your_mysql_username",  // <-- Change this
       "password": "your_mysql_password" // <-- Change this
   }

**2. Run the Database Setup Script:**
   Execute the `1_setup_database.py` script from your terminal. This will create and populate the `little_lemon_db` on your local MySQL server.
   `python 1_setup_database.py`

**3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Once the database is set up, open and run the `2_analysis_and_sales_report.ipynb` notebook cell by cell.

This approach ensures the project runs on your system without requiring you to use my credentials, which is a security best practice.

Thank you!
